# C++ assignments

The repository contains the C++ assignments made for the "C++ for programmers" (INFT2503) course, fall 2022.

These projects are mandatory but do not count towards the final grade in the subject.

[![CMake build](https://github.com/Marko19907/CPP-assignments/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Marko19907/CPP-assignments/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Usage

The course used some external libraries and a custom IDE developed by the professor, more details in the [install.md](/install.md), however, it is possible to use any other IDE, like CLion for example. 

### Debian/Linux Mint/Ubuntu example

1. Install the required dependencies with this command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev liblldb-dev || sudo apt-get install libclang-6.0-dev liblldb-6.0-dev || sudo apt-get install libclang-4.0-dev liblldb-4.0-dev || sudo apt-get install libclang-3.8-dev liblldb-3.8-dev
sudo apt-get install universal-ctags || sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
sudo apt-get install git cmake make g++ clang-format pkg-config libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-serialization-dev libgtksourceviewmm-3.0-dev aspell-en libaspell-dev libgit2-dev
```

2. You can now run the code with juCi++ or any other IDE.
